Do you want user A to have access to certain endpoints and user B to have access to another set of endpoints? How do you control who can access what?

Well, the answers is... TheWall! This simple nodejs package allows you to indicate which user can access which endpoints. Each user can have any or many roles and each role has access to a given set of endpoints, and yes you can parameterize the endpoints.
